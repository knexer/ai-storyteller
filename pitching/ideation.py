The first step in your process is ideation - workshop a bunch of ideas and find the ones with that special spark.

Your client has provided some constraints for you to satisfy, but within those constraints you have total artistic control, so get creative with it!
Client constraints:
{context.graph_input()["conditioning_info"]}

Each idea should have a title and a 2-3 sentence premise mentioning the protagonist, the setting, and the conflict, while also highlighting what makes the story interesting.
Here's an example of a successful premise:
â€œRomeo and Juliet": Two teens, Romeo and Juliet, pursue their forbidden love with each otherâ€”to the chagrin of their rival families. When Juliet must choose between her family and her heart, both lovers must find a way to stay united, even if fate won't allow it.


Come up with a numbered list of eight of your best ideas. Focus on variety within the scope of the client's requests.
